# Anabolic Ice Cream
---
## Ingedients
	-   300g cashew milk
	-   1 scoop protein
	    -   (chocolate is good)
	-   Stevia to taste
	-   1/4 tsp Xanthum gum
	-   210g frozen fruit
	    -   (strawberry are good and low-cal)
	-   A lot of ice
	    -   (estimated 3 cups, 16 cubes for me)
	    - more ice makes it more thick

## Directions
	1. Blend all together until forms a thick smoothie. 
		- This will take some time to get the right consistency. 
		- Try to aim for the ice not being noticeable anymore. 
		- You will need something to help push ingredients down in blender.
